# Haiku
Hello World
Paris: Every adversity | LLM: Adversity comes,
Paris: Is accompanied by | LLM: Yet hidden within its grasp,
Paris: An equivalent advantage. | LLM: Advantage will rise.
Five syllables long
Time endlessly flows along
Summer leaves are gone
Soft petals dancing,
Whispering secrets to breeze,
Nature's gentle song.

One line is too short
Goodbye World
